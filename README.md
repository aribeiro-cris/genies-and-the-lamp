### Welcome to Arabian Night
This is my version of the Magic Lamp using Java. For this exercise, it was created Menu Options where the user can choose between the options below.

## How it works:
1 - Create New Magic Lamp

2 - Choose Magic Lamp: the Lamp can have a Friendly, Grumpy, or Demon Genie.

3 - Rub Magic Lamp: each time you rub the lamp a different type of Genie will be released and a wish will be granted.

4 - Compare Magic Lamp: you can compare the lamps according to the number of Genies each Lamp has and the times that the Lamp was recharged.
